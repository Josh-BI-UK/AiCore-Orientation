    "A list is a Python construct used to store an number of items. A List can hold mixed data types like Strings, Integers, and Objects.; list can even be nested one within another (i.e. a list can hold other \"child/sub\" lists, which in turn can hold \"grandchildren/sub-sub\" list, without any limit.). Lists are defined by enclosing a valid Python data object, in any order, with ssquare brackets '`[]`' with each element/item within the square brackets is separated by a comma \"`,`\".\n",

    "3. we define a variable called `company` which the for loop will use to store the result of the statement, in our case the names of the companies. \n",
    "    - You can call this variable whatever you like. Typically, programmers use the letter \"i\" or \"x\"; you can really choose anything you want, as long as it is logical and helps others reading your code to understand what it is you are trying to achieve. Using a singular noun makes sense when your variable name is written as a plural.\n",
    "    - You can even use an existing varible, however, be careful here as the for loop will redefine whatever the old varible name pointed to.\n",
    "4. we then use the `in` operator to tell python to search within our object (i.e. our `companies` list) and then iterate over it.\n",
    "5. We `print` the output of the loop, storted within our newly defined variable `company`.\n",
